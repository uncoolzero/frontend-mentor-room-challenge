## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling

### What I learned

This was a lot of fun! One thing I was particularly worried about was making sure that the arrow buttons in desktop mode would align themselves with the bottom right image perfectly like they do in the design. This took some effort to make fully responsive, as Tailwind doesn't work with dynamic class names, but nothing a little elbow grease and some motivation didn't fix, the resulting code is pretty funny but you can't disagree with the results.

I'm very happy with the way this came out overall.

### Continued development

I want to learn more on flexbox and grid in general. It took me more time than it should have to finally nail down that part of the code.
